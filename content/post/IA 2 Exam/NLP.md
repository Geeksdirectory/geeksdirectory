## Sementic analysis


### Defination
Semantic analysis in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the process of understanding the meaning and interpretation of words, phrases, and sentences in a way that mimics how humans comprehend language. 

or

Semantic analysis is the process of finding the meaning of text.
It can direct computers to understand and interpret sentences, paragraphs or
whole documents by analyzing their grammatical structure and identifying the
relationships between individual words of sentence in a particular context.

### Goal
to capture not just the individual meanings of words, but also how they combine to form coherent and meaningful ideas in a larger context.

The aim of semantic analysis is to draw exact meaning or dictionary meaning
from the text.

### Example

The purpose of this analyzer is to check the text for ==meaningfulness, most==
==important task is to get the proper meaning of sentence.== E.g. “Govind is great”
in this sentence the speaker is talking about lord Govind or about a person
whose name is Govind.

### Uses
This analysis is used in extracting the important information from achieving
human level accuracy from the computers.

It is used in tools like Machine Translations, chatbots, search engines and text
analysis.

### Syntactic & Semantic Analysis:

- Syntactic analysis determines and checks whether the instance of the language is “well formed” and analyze its grammatical structure.
- Semantic analysis analyses its meaning & find out whether it “makes sense”.
- Syntactic analysis depends on the types of words, but not on their meaning.
###  Semantic analysis in NLP
- Semantic analysis is the subfield of NLP & ML
- It tries to clear the context of any text and makes one realize the emotions inherent in the sentence.
