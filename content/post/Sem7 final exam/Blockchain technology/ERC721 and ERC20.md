### **Difference Between ERC-20 and ERC-721 Tokens**

|**Aspect**|**ERC-20 Token**|**ERC-721 Token**|
|---|---|---|
|**Definition**|A standard for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.|A standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain.|
|**Fungibility**|Fungible, meaning each token is identical and interchangeable with another.|Non-fungible, meaning each token is unique and cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis.|
|**Use Case**|Primarily used for creating cryptocurrencies, utility tokens, and stablecoins.|Used for creating digital collectibles, art, in-game assets, or other unique items.|
|**Supply**|Typically has a fixed or variable total supply, and each unit has the same value.|Each token is unique, and there is no requirement for a fixed supply. Each token may have different properties and values.|
|**Transferability**|Tokens can be transferred freely between users, with identical value for all tokens.|Each token can be transferred, but its value and uniqueness may vary based on its characteristics.|
|**Metadata**|Metadata (e.g., name, symbol, decimals) is the same for every token in the contract.|Each token has unique metadata, often representing ownership of digital assets like art, videos, or virtual goods.|
|**Example**|DAI, USDC, Uniswap (UNI), Tether (USDT).|CryptoKitties, Decentraland (LAND), Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC).|
|**Interoperability**|ERC-20 tokens can be easily traded on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and used across decentralized applications (dApps).|ERC-721 tokens are more specialized and are typically traded on NFT marketplaces or used within specific dApps.|
|**Smart Contract Functions**|Has functions like `totalSupply()`, `balanceOf()`, `transfer()`, `approve()`, etc.|Has functions like `ownerOf()`, `getApproved()`, `safeTransferFrom()`, etc., to handle the uniqueness of each token.|
|**Divisibility**|ERC-20 tokens are divisible into smaller units (e.g., 1 token = 10^18 wei for Ethereum).|ERC-721 tokens are indivisible; each token is a whole unit and cannot be divided.|
|**Standardization**|ERC-20 is widely adopted and used for a variety of purposes, including as a standard for ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings).|ERC-721 is specifically designed for NFTs, which represent ownership of unique digital assets.|

### **Key Differences**

1. **Fungibility vs. Non-Fungibility:**
    
    - **ERC-20** tokens are **fungible**: One token is always equal in value to another. This is ideal for currencies, rewards, or tokens that need to be interchangeable.
    - **ERC-721** tokens are **non-fungible**: Each token is unique and represents something distinct, like a digital artwork, collectible, or item in a game.
2. **Use Cases:**
    
    - **ERC-20** tokens are used for **cryptocurrencies, utility tokens, and stablecoins** (e.g., DAI, USDC, or tokens for accessing specific services).
    - **ERC-721** tokens are used for **NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)**, which are **unique** digital items like art, music, and virtual real estate (e.g., CryptoKitties, digital art, in-game items).
3. **Supply and Divisibility:**
    
    - **ERC-20 tokens** are divisible into smaller units (e.g., 0.0001 tokens), whereas **ERC-721 tokens** are indivisible (you can only own one whole token at a time).

### **Examples**

- **ERC-20 Tokens:**
    - **DAI**: A stablecoin pegged to the value of the US dollar.
    - **USDC**: A stablecoin backed by the US dollar, issued by Centre.
    - **UNI**: The governance token for the Uniswap decentralized exchange.
- **ERC-721 Tokens:**
    - **CryptoKitties**: A collection of digital cats that are unique and can be bought, sold, or bred.
    - **Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC)**: A collection of 10,000 unique, hand-drawn NFTs with special access privileges for owners.
    - **Decentraland (LAND)**: Virtual real estate in the Decentraland metaverse, represented by unique ERC-721 tokens.

### **Conclusion**

- **ERC-20 tokens** are primarily used for creating fungible tokens that can be used like currency or for utility purposes.
- **ERC-721 tokens** represent **unique digital assets** or collectibles, offering individuality and ownership over a specific item, typically in the form of NFTs.

Both ERC-20 and ERC-721 play essential roles in the Ethereum ecosystem, addressing different needs within the blockchain space.
