### **Difference Between Blockchain 1.0 and Blockchain 2.0**

|**Aspect**|**Blockchain 1.0**|**Blockchain 2.0**|
|---|---|---|
|**Definition**|The first generation of blockchain focused on cryptocurrency.|The second generation of blockchain that introduced smart contracts and dApps.|
|**Primary Use Case**|Digital currency and secure peer-to-peer payments (e.g., Bitcoin).|Beyond currency, includes decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts.|
|**Key Platforms**|Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin.|Ethereum, EOS, Hyperledger, Cardano.|
|**Focus**|Cryptocurrency transactions.|Programmable blockchain with logic (smart contracts).|
|**Transaction Type**|Basic transactions (send/receive digital currency).|Complex programmable transactions (logic-based).|
|**Smart Contracts**|Not supported.|Supported; automated execution of agreements.|
|**dApps (Decentralized Apps)**|Not possible.|Enabled by platforms like Ethereum and EOS.|
|**Tokenization**|Limited to native tokens like Bitcoin (BTC).|Custom tokens (e.g., ERC-20, ERC-721) can be created.|
|**Complexity**|Simple ledger system for tracking transactions.|Complex and programmable ecosystem.|
|**Scalability**|Limited to basic cryptocurrency needs.|Focused on improving transaction speeds and scalability for broader applications.|
|**Customization**|No customization possible.|Custom blockchains and applications can be created.|
|**Consensus Mechanism**|Primarily Proof of Work (PoW).|Supports PoW, Proof of Stake (PoS), and others.|
|**Energy Efficiency**|Energy-intensive due to PoW mining.|More energy-efficient with PoS and other mechanisms.|
|**Interoperability**|Very limited; no cross-chain communication.|Focus on cross-chain functionality and interoperability.|
|**Adoption**|Primarily by cryptocurrency users.|Adopted by enterprises, developers, and industries.|
|**Enterprise Use Cases**|Rarely used for enterprise solutions.|Widely used for supply chain, healthcare, and finance.|
|**Innovation Level**|First generation, introducing the blockchain concept.|Second generation, expanding use cases and functionality.|
|**Examples**|Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash.|Ethereum, Polkadot, Hyperledger.|
|**Data Storage**|Only transaction data.|Transaction data + executable code (smart contracts).|
|**Community Support**|Crypto enthusiasts.|Developers, enterprises, crypto users.|
|**Privacy Features**|Limited to pseudonymity.|Advanced features like Zero-Knowledge Proofs in some implementations.|
