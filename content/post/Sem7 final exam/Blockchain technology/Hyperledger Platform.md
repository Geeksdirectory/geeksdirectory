**Hyperledger** is an ==open-source== collaborative effort hosted by the **Linux Foundation** that focuses on developing frameworks, tools, and libraries for enterprise-grade blockchain systems. Unlike public blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum, Hyperledger is designed for **permissioned, private blockchain networks** where participants are known and trusted.

### **Key Goals of Hyperledger**

1. **Enterprise-Grade Blockchains:**
    - Provide scalable and secure solutions tailored for business use cases.
2. **Permissioned Access:**
    - Networks where only authorized participants can join and interact.
3. **Modularity and Customization:**
    - Allow businesses to customize the blockchain architecture to their needs.
4. **Interoperability:**
    - Support communication and data sharing between different blockchain systems.
