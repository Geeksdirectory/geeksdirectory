### **Key Considerations**

1. **Hot Wallets**:
    
    - Best for active users who need quick and frequent access to their cryptocurrency.
    - Ensure you enable strong security measures like two-factor authentication (2FA) and use only trusted wallets.
2. **Cold Wallets**:
    
    - Suitable for long-term holders ("HODLers") who prioritize security over convenience.
    - Keep your recovery phrases and hardware wallets in a safe place to prevent loss.

### **Which One Should You Choose?**

- **Hot Wallet**: Use for everyday transactions, small amounts, or trading.
- **Cold Wallet**: Use for storing large amounts of cryptocurrency securely over the long term.

**Recommendation**: A combination of both (a hot wallet for daily use and a cold wallet for secure storage) is often the best approach for managing cryptocurrency effectively.
