Hereâ€™s a clear comparison between **Fungible Tokens (FTs)** and **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)** in a tabular format:

|**Aspect**|**Fungible Tokens (FTs)**|**Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)**|
|---|---|---|
|**Definition**|Tokens that are interchangeable and identical to each other.|Tokens that are unique and cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis.|
|**Interchangeability**|Fungible tokens are interchangeable; one token is equivalent to another of the same value.|Non-fungible tokens are unique and not interchangeable; each one has its own value and characteristics.|
|**Example**|Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), US Dollar (USD)|Cryptokitties, Decentraland land, art on OpenSea|
|**Divisibility**|Fungible tokens are divisible into smaller units (e.g., 1 Bitcoin can be divided into 100 million satoshis).|NFTs are indivisible; they cannot be divided into smaller units.|
|**Usage**|Used as currency, store of value, or for transferring value.|Represent ownership or proof of authenticity of unique items, such as art, collectibles, real estate, etc.|
|**Value Determination**|Value is determined by the market, but all tokens of the same type have the same value.|Each NFT has a unique value based on rarity, desirability, and other factors.|
|**Standard**|ERC-20 (Ethereum standard), BEP-20 (Binance Smart Chain)|ERC-721, ERC-1155 (Ethereum standards for NFTs)|
|**Ownership**|Ownership is tracked via balance (wallet address), and can represent any amount of the token.|Ownership is tracked through a unique token ID, and can represent a specific item or asset.|
|**Example in Crypto**|Bitcoin, Ethereum, Stablecoins|Cryptokitties, Digital art, Virtual assets in games|
|**Liquidity**|Highly liquid due to standardized and interchangeable nature.|Less liquid, as each NFT is unique and may take longer to find a buyer for specific items.|
|**Transferability**|Easy to transfer and trade in large quantities.|Transferable but might require finding a specific buyer for a unique item.|

### **Summary**

- **Fungible tokens** are like traditional money (e.g., USD or BTC), where each unit is identical to another and can be used interchangeably.
- **Non-fungible tokens** represent unique digital assets, often linked to specific items or properties (e.g., digital art or virtual real estate), and each token has its own value and distinct characteristics.
