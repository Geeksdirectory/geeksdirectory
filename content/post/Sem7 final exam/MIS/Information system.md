### What is IS and its types ?

An **Information System (IS)** is a structured framework that involves the ==collection, storage, management, and dissemination of data and information.== It combines technology, people, and processes to support decision-making, coordination, control, analysis, and visualization in an organization or setting.

Information technology (IT) and Information systems (IS) are used by organizations to enhance their performance.

From the point of view of Information Systems it is necessary to understand the difference between data, information and knowledge although they sound quiet similar.

##### **1. Data**

- **Definition**: Data is raw, unprocessed facts and figures without context or meaning.
- **Characteristics**:
    - May include numbers, symbols, text, or observations.
    - Has no inherent structure or interpretation.
    - Serves as the foundation for information and knowledge.
- **Example**: "123", "John", "50°F".

##### **2. Information**

- **Definition**: Information is processed, organized, or structured data that has context and meaning.
- **Characteristics**:
    - Answers questions like "who," "what," "where," and "when."
    - Is meaningful and useful for decision-making.
    - Created by analyzing, sorting, or organizing data.
- **Example**: "John scored 123 runs in the cricket match" or "The temperature in New York is 50°F."

An information system is a set of organized and interrelated components that work collectively to collect, store, process and disseminate information for a specific purpose, like to support decision making, coordination, control, analysis, and visualization in an organization.

#### Role of Information Systems in Organizations

##### Information Storage and Analysis
- Store large volumes of data securely and efficiently.
- Enable quick retrieval of data for analysis and reporting.
- Provide tools for analyzing trends, patterns, and performance metrics (e.g., dashboards, data visualization).
- Ensure data integrity and consistency across departments through centralized databases.

 ##### **Assist in Decision Making**
 - Provide accurate and timely information for strategic, tactical, and operational decisions.
- Support decision-making with predictive analytics, simulations, and scenario modeling.
- Facilitate real-time monitoring and adjustments using up-to-date data (e.g., inventory levels, market trends).
- Enable collaboration among stakeholders with shared access to information.

 ##### **Assist with Business Processes**
- Automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks (e.g., payroll processing, customer invoicing).
- Streamline workflows by integrating systems across departments (e.g., ERP systems).
- Enhance communication and coordination among teams using collaboration tools.
- Improve customer service through CRM systems that track interactions and preferences.
