**Types of Computer-Based Information Systems (CBIS)** can be categorized based on their ==purpose, users, and the types of decisions they support==. Here are the key types:

---

##### **1. Transaction Processing Systems (TPS)**
- **Purpose**: Handle and record routine, day-to-day business transactions.
- **Features**:
  - Ensure accuracy and reliability in processing large volumes of data.
  - Act as the foundation for other types of information systems.
- **Examples**:
  - Point-of-sale systems in retail.
  - Payroll systems.
  - Order processing systems.

---

##### **2. Management Information Systems (MIS)**
- **Purpose**: Provide summarized and structured information to middle managers for decision-making and reporting.
- **Features**:
  - ==Transform raw data from TPS into meaningful reports==.
  - ==Focus on operational efficiency and short-term planning==.
- **Examples**: 
  - Monthly sales reports.
  - Inventory control systems.

---

##### **3. Decision Support Systems (DSS)**
- **Purpose**: Help managers and analysts make complex, non-routine decisions by analyzing data and presenting simulations or models.
- **Features**:
  - Support "what-if" analysis and scenario modeling.
  - Often incorporate external data and predictive analytics.
- **Examples**:
  - Investment analysis tools.
  - Production scheduling systems.

---

##### **4. Executive Information Systems (EIS) / Executive Support Systems (ESS)**
- **Purpose**: ==Provide top executives with easy-to-access, summarized, and graphical data to support strategic decision-making==.
- **Features**:
  - Focus on long-tercomplex, non-routine decisions by analyzing data and presenting simulations or models.m planning and external environment analysis.
  - Use dashboards and data visualization.
- **Examples**:
  - Market trend analysis systems.
  - Corporate performance dashboards.

---

##### **5. Enterprise Systems**
- **Purpose**: Integrate core business processes across departments into a unified system.
- **Features**:
  - Ensure seamless information flow between functional areas.
  - Improve operational efficiency and collaboration.
- **Examples**:
  - Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems (e.g., SAP, Oracle).
  - Supply Chain Management (SCM) systems.

---
