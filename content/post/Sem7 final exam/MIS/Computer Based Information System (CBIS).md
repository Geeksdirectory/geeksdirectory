##### **1. Hardware**
- The physical devices and equipment used in the system.
- Includes:
  - Input devices (e.g., keyboards, scanners).
  - Processing units (e.g., CPUs, GPUs).
  - Output devices (e.g., monitors, printers).
  - Storage devices (e.g., hard drives, SSDs).

---

##### **2. Software**
- The set of instructions and programs that operate the hardware.
- Types:
  - **System Software**: Operating systems and utilities (e.g., Windows, Linux).
  - **Application Software**: Tools for specific tasks (e.g., CRM software, ERP systems).

---

##### **3. Database**
- Organized collection of data that can be accessed, managed, and updated.
- Ensures data integrity, security, and availability.
- Examples:
  - Relational databases (e.g., MySQL, Oracle).
  - Cloud databases (e.g., Amazon RDS).

---

##### **4. Communication-Network**
- The infrastructure that enables connectivity and data exchange between system components.
- Includes:
  - Networking hardware (e.g., routers, switches).
  - Protocols for communication (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP).
  - Communication media (e.g., fiber optics, Wi-Fi).

---

##### **5. Business Procedure**
- Standardized methods and workflows that the CBIS supports or automates.
- Define how tasks are completed and decisions are made using the system.
- Examples:
  - Order processing procedures.
  - Payroll management systems.

---

##### **6. People**
- The users and stakeholders involved in the system's operation.
- Categories:
  - **End-users**: Employees or customers who interact with the system.
  - **IT staff**: Developers, administrators, and support personnel.
  - **Decision-makers**: Managers and executives relying on the system for insights.

### **Summary in Table Form**:

| **Component**             | **Description**                                                                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Hardware**              | Physical devices like computers, storage, and networking equipment.            |
| **Software**              | Programs that instruct the hardware to perform tasks.                          |
| **Database**              | ==Central repository of structured data== for efficient access and management. |
| **Communication-Network** | Infrastructure for data sharing and connectivity across systems.               |
| **Business Procedure**    | Workflows and rules governing the use of the CBIS.                             |
| **People**                | Users, IT staff, and decision-makers interacting with the system.              |

Each of these components plays a critical role in ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of a CBIS. Together, they create a cohesive system for managing and using information within an organization.
