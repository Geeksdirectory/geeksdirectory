**N-Grams** are a fundamental concept in Natural Language Processing (NLP), ==representing contiguous sequences of N items (words, characters, or other tokens) from a given text or speech==. They are commonly used for tasks like text analysis, predictive modeling, and language modeling.

### **1. Definition**

An **N-Gram** is a continuous sequence of NNN items extracted from a larger sequence of text.

- **Unigram**: Single token (e.g., word or character).
- **Bigram**: Sequence of two tokens.
- **Trigram**: Sequence of three tokens.
- **N-Gram**: General term for sequences of NNN tokens.

### **2. Types of N-Grams**

1. **Word N-Grams**:
    
    - Based on words as tokens.
    - Example: _"I love NLP"_.
        - **Unigrams**: [I], [love], [NLP]
        - **Bigrams**: [I love], [love NLP]
        - **Trigrams**: [I love NLP]
2. **Character N-Grams**:
    
    - Based on individual characters.
    - Example: _"NLP"_
        - **Unigrams**: [N], [L], [P]
        - **Bigrams**: [NL], [LP]
        - **Trigrams**: [NLP]

### **4. Applications of N-Grams**

1. **Language Modeling**:
    - Predict the next word in a sequence.
    - Example: Given _"I love"_, predict _"NLP"_ using bigrams.

2. **Text Classification**:   
    - Extract N-Gram features for spam detection, sentiment analysis, or topic modeling.

3. **Spell Correction**:
    - Identify likely corrections by analyzing N-Gram frequency in a language corpus.

4. **Machine Translation**:
    - Improve translation by capturing short context sequences using N-Grams.

5. **Speech Recognition**:
    - Predict word sequences from phoneme data.

6. **Plagiarism Detection**:
    - Detect similarities in text by comparing N-Grams between documents.

7. **Information Retrieval**:    
    - Enhance search engine accuracy by matching query terms using N-Grams

### **5. Advantages**

- **Context Representation**:
    - Captures local context in text.
- **Simplicity**:
    - Easy to generate and use for basic NLP tasks.
- **Flexibility**:
    - Applicable to words, characters, or phonemes.

### **6. Disadvantages**

- **Curse of Dimensionality**:
    - Higher NNN values lead to exponential growth in the N-Gram space, requiring more memory and computational power.
- **Lack of Long-Range Dependencies**:
    - Cannot capture relationships beyond the immediate NNN-length sequence.
- **Data Sparsity**:
    - For large NNN, many N-Grams may not appear in the training data.

---

### **9. Limitations and Modern Approaches**

- N-Grams fail to capture long-term dependencies in text.
- Modern models like **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**, **Transformers**, and **BERT** handle context better by modeling entire sentences or documents rather than local N-Grams.

N-Grams are foundational tools in NLP for capturing context in text data. While simple and effective for many applications, they are limited by their fixed context size and data sparsity issues, making them less effective for complex, long-range dependencies. Despite these limitations, N-Grams remain a valuable starting point for many NLP tasks.
