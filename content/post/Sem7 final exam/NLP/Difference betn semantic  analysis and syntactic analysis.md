### **Difference Between Semantic Analysis and Syntactic Analysis**

| **Aspect**                   | **Syntactic Analysis**                                                                    | **Semantic Analysis**                                                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**               | ==Focuses== on the structure or ==grammar== of sentences.                                 | ==Focuses== on the ==meaning== and ==interpretation== of words, phrases, and sentences.        |
| **Objective**                | ==Ensures sentences are grammatically correct.==                                          | Ensures sentences are ==meaningful== and ==contextually accurate.==                            |
| **Key Concern**              | Checks the ==arrangement== of words in a ==sentence== according to ==grammatical rules==. | Checks the ==contextual meaning== of words and phrases.                                        |
| **Output**                   | Produces a ==parse tree== or ==syntax tree showing== grammatical structure.               | Produces a ==logical or semantic== ==representation== of the input text.                       |
| **Scope**                    | Limited to ==grammar== and ==syntax rules of a language==.                                | ==Goes beyond syntax== to understand context, relationships, and deeper meanings.              |
| **Ambiguity**                | ==Resolves structural ambiguities== (e.g., sentence phrasing).                            | ==Resolves semantic ambiguities== (e.g., word meanings in context).                            |
| **Techniques Used**          | Parsing algorithms (e.g., CFG parsers, dependency parsing).                               | Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD), Named Entity Recognition (NER), Semantic Role Labeling (SRL). |
| **Challenges**               | Handling complex grammatical structures and ambiguities in sentence structure.            | Interpreting idioms, metaphors, slang, and domain-specific language.                           |
| **Example**                  | Checks if "He runs fastly" is grammatically correct (it's not).                           | Determines if "He runs a bank" means managing a financial institution or something else.       |
| **Dependency on Each Other** | Semantic analysis requires syntactic analysis as a foundation.                            | Syntactic analysis does not require semantic analysis to check grammar.                        |
| **Applications**             | Used in grammar checking tools, compiler design, and sentence parsing.                    | Used in machine translation, chatbots, sentiment analysis, and question answering.             |
