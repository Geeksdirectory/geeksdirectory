focused on understanding the meaning and context of words, sentences, and text. It goes beyond syntax to interpret the relationships between words and their meanings in specific contexts.

---
### **1. Definition**

- Semantic analysis interprets the **meaning** of words, phrases, sentences, and larger text units.
- It helps machines understand language at a deeper level by analyzing **contextual meaning** rather than just grammatical structures.

---
### **2. Objectives of Semantic Analysis**

1. **Understanding Word Meaning**:
    - Recognize and differentiate between meanings of the same word (e.g., "bank" as a financial institution vs. riverbank).

2. **Identifying Relationships**:    
    - Establish connections between entities (e.g., in “Alice owns a car,” Alice is related to a car by ownership).

3. **Disambiguating Context**:
    - Resolve ambiguities in word usage depending on the context (e.g., "crane" as a bird or a machine).

4. **Generating Human-Like Responses**:
    - Support applications like chatbots or virtual assistants that need to respond naturally.

### **3. Levels of Semantic Analysis**

1. **Lexical Semantics**:
    - Studies the meaning of individual words, including:
        - Synonyms (e.g., "big" and "large").
        - Antonyms (e.g., "hot" vs. "cold").
        - Homonyms (e.g., "bark" of a tree vs. a dog's bark).

2. **Sentence Semantics**:    
    - Explores the meaning of a complete sentence by analyzing:
        - Sentence structure.
        - How words contribute to overall meaning.

3. **Discourse Semantics**:
    - Focuses on the meaning of larger text units (paragraphs, documents) to understand **coherence** and **context**.

4. **Pragmatics**:
    - Interprets implied meaning based on situational context (e.g., "Can you pass the salt?" is a request, not a literal question).

---

### **4. Components of Semantic Analysis**

1. **Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)**:
    
    - Identifies the correct meaning of a word in context (e.g., "The bat flew in the night" refers to the animal, not the sports equipment).

1. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**:
    
    - Identifies and classifies entities in text (e.g., “Barack Obama” as a person, “Google” as an organization).

1. **Semantic Role Labeling (SRL)**:
    
    - Assigns roles to words in a sentence (e.g., who did what to whom).

1. **Relationship Extraction**:
    
    - Identifies connections between entities (e.g., “Google acquired YouTube” shows an acquisition relationship).

### **5. Methods Used in Semantic Analysis**

1. ==**Rule-Based Approaches**:==
    - Relies on manually defined linguistic rules and patterns for interpretation.
2. ==**Machine Learning-Based Approaches**:==
    - Uses algorithms like **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** or **neural networks** to learn patterns from annotated data.
3. ==**Deep Learning Approaches**:==
    - Leverages models like **BERT**, **GPT**, and **transformers** to understand context and meaning.

### 6. Applications of Semantic Analysis

- search engines
- chatbots and virtual assistants
- sentiment analysis
- text summarization
- machine translation
- e-comm

---

### 7. Advantages

- improved understanding of text
- enhanced UI
- context - aware search
- better decision making

---

### 8. Challenges 
- ambiguity
- idioms and slangs
- domain specific lang
- resource req
- low resourse lang
---

### **9. Key Concepts in Semantic Analysis**

1. **Ontology**:
    - A structured representation of concepts and their relationships in a domain.
2. **Word Embeddings**:
    - Vector representations of words (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) that capture semantic relationships.
3. **Semantic Similarity**:
    - Measures how similar two pieces of text are in meaning.
4. **Contextual Understanding**:
    - Interprets meaning based on surrounding words and sentences.

### **10. Example of Semantic Analysis**

#### Sentence:

_"John went to the bank to deposit money."_

1. **Word Sense Disambiguation**:
    - "Bank" here refers to a financial institution, not a riverbank.
2. **Named Entity Recognition**:
    - "John" is a person.
3. **Semantic Role Labeling**:
    - "John" is the subject (who).
    - "Deposit money" is the action (what).
    - "Bank" is the location (where).
