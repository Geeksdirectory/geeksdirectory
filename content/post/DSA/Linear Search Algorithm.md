A simple algorithm that checks each element in the array until the target element is found or the end of the array is reached.

> start searching from the first element till the element which we are finding 

we use for loop in linear searching

time complexity :

- Best Case: O(1)    // constant
- Worst Case: O(n)  // here n is the size of the array

O(n) (upper bound time complexity) means it will never go worst then linear, it is always better than linear


space complexity means are you taking extra space (extra space taken)
