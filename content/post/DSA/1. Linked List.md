==Linear DS consist of nodes with some sort of data, and a pointer, or link, to the next node.==
**data**: The value stored in the node 
**Pointer/Link**: a reference to the next node on the sequence 

A big **benefit** with using linked lists is that ==nodes are stored wherever there is free space in memory, the nodes do not have to be stored contiguously right after each other like elements are stored in arrays==. Another nice thing with linked lists is that when adding or removing nodes, the rest of the nodes in the list do not have to be shifted.

#### Types
1. **singly linked list**: Each node points to the next node
2. **Doubly Linked List**: Each node points to both the next and previous nodes.
3. **Circular Linked List**: The last node points back to the first node.

#### Basic Operations in Linked Lists

1. **Insertion**:
    - At the beginning.
    - At the end.
    - At a specific position.
2. **Deletion**:
    - From the beginning.
    - From the end.
    - From a specific position.
3. **Traversal**:
    - Printing all elements.
    - Counting nodes.
4. **Search**:
    - Finding a specific value.
5. **Reverse the Linked List**.

#### Linked list vs Array

In memory, an **array** is stored in [[contiguous memory locations]], where elements are accessed via direct indexing, making it faster for random access but requiring a fixed size. In contrast, a **linked list** stores nodes in ==non-contiguous memory==, connected by pointers, allowing ==dynamic resizing== but with ==slower access due to sequential traversal.==


The image below shows ==how a linked list can be stored in memory==. The linked list has four nodes with values 3, 5, 13 and 2, and each node has a pointer to the next node in the list.

> Unlike with arrays, the nodes in a linked list are not placed right after each other in memory. This means that when inserting or removing a node, shifting of other nodes is not necessary, so that is a good thing.


### Types of linked list

1. singly linked lists
2. Doubly linked lists
3. Circular linked list

A **singly linked list** is the ==simplest kind of linked lists==. It takes up ==less space in memory because each node has only one address to the next nod==e, like in the image below.

A **doubly linked list** has nodes with ==addresses to both the previous and the next node==, like in the image below, and therefore ==takes up more memory==. But doubly linked lists are ==good if you want to be able to move both up and down in the list.==

**circular linked list** is like a singly or doubly linked list with the first node, the "head", and the last node, the "tail", connected.

Circular linked lists are good for lists you need to cycle through continuously.
