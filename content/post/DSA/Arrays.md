why we need arrays

- array is collection of datatypes 
- Arrays are a type of static data structure because their size is predefined and unchangeable.
- Array indices start from 0.
- Arrays ==store elements of the same data type==, e.g., all integers, all strings, etc.

**Advantages in Java:**

- Simple to use for storing fixed-size collections of data.
- Provides a direct way to manage memory.

syntax
datatype[] variable_name = ==new== datatype[size];


here ==new== is a keyword used to create an object


ed : int[] numbers = new int[5];

int[] rnos = new int[5];
or
int[] rnos2 = {12,23,21,34,43};

> In java their is no concept of pointers 

array objects are in heap

> all objects in java is stored in heap

heap object are not continous (memory are one by one allocated)

array objects  in java may not be continuous (it depends on jvm)

### passing through function

string are immutable and arrays are mutable in java (here mutable means we can change object)
