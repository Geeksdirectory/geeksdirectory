Kubernetes (k8s) authentication and authorization are two essential security mechanisms to control access to the cluster.

Authentication in Kubernetes verifies the identity of users or components trying to interact with the API server.

Kubernetes does **not** have a built-in user management system. Instead, it relies on external authentication mechanisms.

### **Authentication Methods in Kubernetes**

1. **X.509 Client Certificates**
    - Users authenticate using certificates issued by the Kubernetes certificate authority (CA).
    - Configured via `kubeconfig` file (`kubectl config set-credentials ...`).
2. **Static Token File**
    - Predefined token file is passed to the API server at startup.
    - Deprecated and not recommended for production.
3. **Bootstrap Tokens**
    - Temporary tokens used for bootstrapping new nodes.
4. **Service Account Tokens**
    - Used by pods running inside the cluster to authenticate against the API server.
    - Tokens are auto-mounted inside pods at `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token`.
5. **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**
    - Integrates Kubernetes with external identity providers like **Google, Okta, Keycloak** for authentication.
6. **Webhook Token Authentication**
    - A webhook validates credentials against an external authentication service.
7. **Authentication Proxy**
    - Uses an external reverse proxy (e.g., NGINX, Istio, OAuth2-proxy) to handle authentication.
