**Namespaces** are a way to logically divide and isolate resources within a cluster

They help in organizing and managing different environments (like dev, staging, prod) or teams within a single cluster. Each namespace can have its own set of resources, such as pods, services, and config maps, and they allow better control over resource allocation and access control.

Key points:

- Isolate resources between environments or teams.
- Default namespace is used if none is specified.
- Useful for managing access and quotas.
